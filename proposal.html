	<h1>Efficient Household Grocery Utilization</h1>

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<p>
			Over the course of my college career, adulting has been a struggle when it comes to eating healthy or regularly. I found that I would buy multiple ingredients only to have them go bad. I've also, on many accounts, chosen not to eat because the food that I want to make is missing one key ingredient. I am very spontaneous when it comes to eating thus, the question I've been pondering for a couple of years now is "How can I simplify the process of buying ingredients as well as eating them, individually or in a recipe, before they expire? How can I increase efficiency and eliminate the idea that this action is a chore?"

			Essentially, there are many apps that are centered around recipes with tons of information. However, my proposed solution combines this functionality with a database of all ingredients in someone's household that can be utilized for cooking. There are apps that utilize this inefficiently but ideally in the future, I would like to make it scanner-enabled eliminating the need for manual input and creating a solution that is less recipe focused and more inventory focused.

			Some apps that I have looked into include Side Chef: Recipes+Meal Planner and Lifesum: Diet & Macros Tracker. The scopes for these applications however resolve around health and the planning of meals along with their nutritional value. The application <a href="https://devpost.com/software/iperish">iPerish</a> is similar to my idea however my scope is larger in that it incorporates recipes as well.

		<h2>Proposed Application</h2>
		<p>
			My proposed solution is a web application designed to provide information regarding what kind of recipes can be made given a user's current stock of ingredients. To make sure food is not wasted; the application will notify the user when an item is approaching or exceeding its expiration date.

			The users for this application will be mainly households and families however I believe this can also extend to grocery stores and even restaurants.

			<h3>Functionality Walkthrough</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The household or individual utilizing this application will upload the number of ingredients of each type that they have in the pantry or refrigerator.</li>
				<li>Ideally this could be done using a scanner and bar code however this will not be in the scope.</li>
				<li> There will be a database that stores the expiration or amount of time that it is viable for each item to track if an item in their inventory has expired or is about to. This in turn, will provide a notification to the user that could incentivize them to use up that resource.</li>
				<li>Users will be able to view and store recipes that they have either made or could make given the ingredients they have in their inventory.</li>
				<li>There is a potential for the utilization of an API regarding these ingredients and their expiration date (I am still researching possible <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/category/grocery/api">grocery APIs</a>) however I will mainly be using fabricated data in order to reduce potential hiccups throughout this project. With this exploration, I will also research possible <a href="https://www.outofmilk.com/ideas/barcode-scanner-app-usage/">bar code scanning apps</a> for further development outside of this class.</li>
				<li>Additionally, a feature tracking the frequency at which an item is utilized will help inspire a shopping list and give importance to maintaining a constant supply of that item. Notification will be sent to the user when this item is low.</li>
				<li>One way an item will show it has been utilized is when the user chooses a recipe to cook; this will reduce their inventory by the number of ingredients utilized in that recipe.</li>
				<li>Lastly is the possible addition of a shopping list compilation feature given the frequency each item is bought, whether it had to be tossed out due to its expiration, the stock of that item, or the needed ingredients for a specific recipe.</li>
		</ul></section>
		<p>
			Ideally, the information being inputted, generated, and tracked will lead to the elimination of wasted food. It will also act as a grocery list and recipe storage eliminating the need for remembering which items they have currently or need. The recipe generator that compiles a list of recipes within the given parameters will also serve as ways the food can be utilized and will eliminate the hassle of using search engines to find a recipe without obtaining extra ingredients.
